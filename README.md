# Pixi.js scalable SVG demo

This is a demo for the [pull request](https://github.com/pixijs/pixi.js/pull/2614) I created for Pixi.js.

The new Texture API takes in a parameter to adjust scale for the SVG image before creating a texture of it.

Tested on latest Chrome, Firefox and Edge. IE10 and 11 work with canvas fallback.
